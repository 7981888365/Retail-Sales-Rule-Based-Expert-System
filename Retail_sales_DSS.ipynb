        "This project develops a Rule-Based Retail Sales Expert System that evaluates sales patterns and detects potential business risks using IF–THEN decision rules. By analysing monthly sales trends, category-wise performance, customer concentration, pricing behaviour, and revenue fluctuations, the system classifies the overall business condition into risk levels such as Low, Moderate, High, or Critical.\n",
        "\n",
        "The expert system offers clear explanations for each decision, making it transparent, easy to understand, and suitable for academic learning. It demonstrates how rule-based reasoning can convert raw sales data into actionable insights, helping retailers recognize declining trends, unstable revenue patterns, or overdependence on specific customers. This project highlights the practical value of expert systems in improving decision-making and ensuring better business planning\n",

By applying IF–THEN rules, the system detects declining sales, category weaknesses, customer dependency, and volatility. It provides meaningful insights that help retailers understand performance and take corrective action.
